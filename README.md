# Console-Finances

Overview
This project involves analyzing financial records using JavaScript. The dataset, located in the starter/index.js file, consists of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses. The goal is to write JavaScript code that performs the following analyses:

Total Number of Months:
Calculate the total number of months included in the dataset.

Net Total Amount of Profit/Losses:
Calculate the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

Average Change in Profit/Losses:
Calculate the average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period. Track the total change in Profit/Losses from month to month and then find the average. (Total/(Number of months - 1))

Greatest Increase in Profit/Losses:
Identify the month with the greatest increase in Profit/Losses and display both the date and the amount.

Greatest Decrease in Profit/Losses:
Identify the month with the greatest decrease in Profit/Losses and display both the date and the amount.
